                Welcome to <strong>Watches of the Week</strong>, where we'll track the rarest, wildest, and most covetable 
                watches spotted on celebrities.

                Last weekend was basically a Watches of the Week holiday because John Mayer, our patron 
                saint of heavenly horology, stepped onto the Grammys stage with great hair and an even better
                watch. The watch in question is a Patek Philippe 5270G, which is made out of platinum, has 
                a perpetual calendar and chronograph, and sells for <strong>upwards of $130,000 at auction</strong>. Mayer 
                and Patek perpetual calendars have a long history together. In his very first “<strong>Talking Watches</strong>” 
                video with Hodinkee, back in 2013, Mayer said a previous version of this watch with a white 
                dial was “as good as it may ever get.” Mayer clearly hasn’t wavered from that belief. He’s collected 
                a couple more of these watches over the years, including one set with <strong>baguette diamonds</strong>. The 5270G 
                Mayer wore to the Grammy’s is the successor of those iconic watches and part of Patek’s historic 
                lineage of perpetual calendar watches. Also this week, Luke Doncic discovered a new watch brand and 
                Mayer wasn’t the only one wearing a very fine Patek at the Grammy’s.

            <h2>John Mayer’s Patek Philippe 5970P</h2>
            <p class="p2">
                Mayer is beloved among watch collectors because he fully embraces the nerdery of it all—an approach 
                on display in his love for this piece. “I love the American Courier-typewriter font on a perpetual 
                [calendar watch],” he said in <strong>his second “Talking Watches” video</strong>. “It is ‘80s banker Wolf of Wall Stree 
                nonsense, and I really love it.” Of course, the 5270 is beloved for much more than its font. Like its 
                predecessor, this watch is larger than the previous era of Patek’s mega-popular perpetual calendar watches. 
                Sizing up made the watch easier to read, and made the addition of a tachymeter—the ring of numbers along 
                the outside rim used to measure speed—possible. This racecar-driver tool makes the watch look a lot 
                sportier, too. Mayer even calls it Patek’s version of Rolex’s Daytona.

            <h2>Carmelo Anthony’s Hublot Big Bang King Power Porto Cervo Marina 50th Anniversary Costa Smeralda</h2>
            <p class="p2">
                Well, the name of this watch sure is a mouthful. Let’s break it down. Porto Cervo Marina is an Italian 
                resort town on the northern tip of the island Sardinia. One of the very first lines in <strong>Porto Cervo’s Wikipedia</strong>  
                page describes it as “a luxury yacht magnet and billionaires' playground.” In 2012, to celebrate the resort’s 
                50th anniversary, Hublot helped throw a party. Elton John performed for the fat cats and Hublot released two 
                limited-edition watches, including the one worn here by Carmelo Anthony.

            <h2>Lil Baby’s Patek Philippe 5396G Annual Calendar</h2>
            <p class="p2">
               <strong>In a single night earlier this year</strong>, Lil Baby came into two high-priced Richard Mille watches. Neither made 
                the cut for the Grammys red carpet, as the rapper swerved from his wild luxury sports watches to this pristine 
                Patek Philippe. This watch launched in 2006 with a design ported over from a late 1930s Patek Calatrava. 15 years 
                later, and more than eight decades since the original design, it still looks just as good.

            <h2>Luka Dončić’s Hublot Big Bang Gold Ceramic</h2>
            <p class="p2">
                Luka Dončić, who has worn a <strong>gold Audemars Piguet Royal Oak</strong> for most of his still-young career, has apparently 
                discovered a new watch brand he’s very excited about. This week, he wore Hublot’s Big Bang with a gold case and 
                a black ceramic dial. And while I missed it the first time around, <strong>a closer inspection of Dončić’s All-Star 
                weekend fit</strong> shows a flash of orange peeking out from under his sleeve. <strong>Only Hublot has the moxie to make a watch 
                like that.</strong> Clearly someone had a good time at his local authorized dealer.

            <h2>Justin Thomas’s Rolex Daytona</h2>
            <p class="p2">
                Thomas <strong>is a slightly surprising clotheshorse, assuming you count an obscene amount of polos, khakis, and vintage 
                jerseys qualifications for that title.</strong> He has two walk-in closets filled with his gear, including a sizable 
                collection of watches. Among those pieces is this white gold Daytona, the foil to Mayer’s Patek 5790. Watches of the 
                Week: one big circle!
